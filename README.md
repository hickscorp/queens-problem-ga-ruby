# Queens Genetic Algorithm Ruby

## Problem

The queens problem is defined as the following:

On a checker board of width `n` and height `n`, place `n` queens so none of these queens
could take another one. It boils down to having at most one queen per row, column
and diagonal.

Solving this problem is possible when `n` belongs to `[4..Infinity]`.


## Solution

A genetic algorithm could be designed to automatically find a solution to the problem.
